Do we want to care about diplomatic passports or emergency passports?

Do we care about passport validity conditions?

Are we trying to be authoritative?

How to model "pathways" to permanent residence?
eg ARC->ARC->APRC, ARC->Gold Card->APRC, Plum Blossom Card, Tourist Visa->ARC->ARC->APRC
eg Working Holiday-->Working Holiday Extension for 180 days-->Not extendable or convertible
eg Blue Collar Worker Visa can't go to White Collar Worker Visa.

It's not clear whether some visas are single or multiple entry eg Foreign Exchange Student visa

The duration for some visas is not clear (eg Medical Treatment)
