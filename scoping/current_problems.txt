Main BOCA website's General Information section on Visas is highly inaccessible to readers. It's literally a copy/paste of regulations.

Existing Visa documentation does not provide information about why an applicant would select a certain visa. Any useful information in this area is buried in unorganised FAQs in a different part of the site.

Programs such as the Gold Card or the Plum Blossom Card are difficult to find or not listed with other visas.

Permanent residence options are often listed separately, making the path to permanent residence unclear.
